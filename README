I am writting wrappings for oblitum's Interception ( https://github.com/oblitum/Interception )
So that it can be used effortlessly in python

As it is, its not complete and for all I know it may be completely wrong.


This branch aim at making the use of interception more python friendly and moving more of the
mechanincs under the hood.


To do:

Write a better readme
Test if all the exposed functions work as they are supposed to (possibly fix them)
Possibly encapsulate the functions a bit more in order to make their use feel more like python
